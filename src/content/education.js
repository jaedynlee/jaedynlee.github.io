                        "I loved majoring in Computer Science. Northeastern’s curriculum emphasizes positive design habits for readable, extensible code and thorough tests. Most assignments are completed through pair programming, which has strengthened my ability to work alongside others and communicate technical ideas. The opportunity to participate in code walks and design reviews was also incredibly helpful in learning how to read and critique others’ code.",

I believe interactions with technology should be frictionless, and software should only make tasks easier. I look forward to applying my knowledge of psychology to create appealing, useful, and usable software.",

Amazing mentors introduced me to programming, and got me hooked on solving problems, making games, and creating artwork with code. Martial arts taught me discipline and perseverance, as I earned my black belt in Tae Kown Do after training for over 10 years. Volleyball showed me how powerful it is to play and win as a team. Joining the a cappella team proved to myself that I could step outside my comfort zone and succeed. STEM outreach turned me into a leader and teacher."],
