                        "I love studying Computer Science! Northeastern’s curriculum emphasizes positive design habits for readable, extensible code and thorough tests. Most assignments are completed through pair programming, which has strengthened my ability to work alongside others and communicate technical ideas. The opportunity to participate in code walks and design reviews was also incredibly helpful in learning how to read and critique others’ code. After I graduate with my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in 2020, I plan to complete my Master’s degree with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence in 2021.",
                        "Humans are both the creators and users of technology, which is why I chose to study psychology in addition to computer science. I believe interactions with technology should be frictionless, and software should only make tasks easier. I look forward to applying my knowledge of psychology to create appealing, useful, and usable software.",

Joining the a cappella team proved to myself that I could step outside my comfort zone and succeed. STEM outreach turned me into a leader and teacher."],
