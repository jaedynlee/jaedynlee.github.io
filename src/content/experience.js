I loved being part of the Agile process and working with others to reach our team goals. As a member of the full-stack Labor, Payroll, and Cash team, I developed production features and bug fixes for the back-end server and front-end Android and web UIs. I also migrated long-running Selenium UI tests to integration, Espresso, and unit tests to reduce deploy times and modularized legacy monolithic codebase by separating view, application, and business logic layers.
