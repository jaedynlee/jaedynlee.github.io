                        "FirstByte provides educators with the materials and support to bring technology curricula to their classrooms, regardless of budget or technical background. My co-founder and I managed a team of 20 members in our final semester before graduating. Beyond our departure, the club lives on under new leadership.",
                        "In the three years I led the club, we established an ongoing loaner program for Boston Public School teachers to borrow technology kits from FirstByte. We also built our website from scratch, where teachers can download our curricula and share their own. Our curriculum team creates interdisciplinary technology curricula that meet Massachusetts' Digital Literacy Standards and can be easily integrated into schools' existing curricula. In my time, FirstByte lessons were taught to well over 200 students!",
                        "We organized numerous events for the community, such as a professional development night for Boston Public School teachers and a Women in Tech panel, and regularly participated in Northeastern-hosted engineering fairs and expos. FirstByte is a two-time HERlead grant recipient and a Clinton Global Initiative University participant."

As project lead, I worked directly with the client to understand their product needs and refine the project requirements. I led a team of engineers as they developed a React web application where patients can create an account, take surveys, and apply for clinical trials. I implemented an Agile development process with 1-week sprints and iterative development based on client feedback. Throughout the semester, we took the client's product from Ideation, to Prototyping, to Production, and maintained a hosted site used for live demos. "
